Influence maximization in Boolean networks
=======================================================

Code to generalize methods (e.g. mean-field approximation) for influence maximization to Boolean networks.

**Tutorials:**

- Tutorial_Drosophila_SPN.ipynb shows how to run the individual based mean-field approximation (IBMFA), calculate entropy, and retrieve driver sets for biological networks (e.g. the _drosophila_ single-cell SPN).
- Tutorial_RBN.ipynb shows how to run the IBMFA, calculate entropy, and retrieve driver sets for random Boolean networks (RBNs).


**Scripts:**

- mean_field_computations.py (code to run IBMFA)
- entropy_computations.py (code to calculate entropy of network configurations)
- driver_sets.py (code to find driver sets towards fixed points of a network)
- simulations.py (code to run and analyze simulations)
- brute_force_computations.py (code to run and analyze brute-force calculations for small networks)
- RBN_computations.py (code for additional functions needed for RBNs)
- modules.py (utility functions related to influence pathways and code for general threshold networks)
- utils.py (utility functions for the IBMFA)

**Original notebooks:**

Note: the scripts above were created from the functions originally used in the jupyter notebooks below.  If there's a bug in the above code, you may refer to the original function defined in the notebook to help troubleshoot.
- See information_diffusion.ipynb for results on specific genetic regulatory networks (GRNs).

- See Mean-field Approximation in Boolean Networks.ipynb for figure results used in the paper.
- See network_attractors.ipynb for results on attractors and control kernels.  These calculations require code from https://zenodo.org/record/5172898 [2]
